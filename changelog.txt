[B]Retrospect v5.2.20 - Changelog - 2021-01-16[/B]

This version of Retrospect focusses on artwork: we introduced poster artwork for channels and shows. Not all channels support them, but more will come over time.

There are also some channels fixes in this build: VTM and related channels  now redirect to the VTM Go add-on instead of Retrospect. Their add-on handles the VTM channel very nicely. MTV and UR Play.se have also been fixed.
